    Typography: In my project I will select a clean and versatile typography scheme using a maximum of three fonts.
     These fonts are chosen for readability, aesthetic appeal, and their ability to complement the overall design.
    
     1. Primary Font: "Lato" (Sans-Serif)
    Use:
    Body text (paragraphs).
    Navigation links.
    Buttons.
    Footer text.
    Reason:

    "Lato" offers excellent readability and a modern, clean look, making it perfect for general text content.


    2. Secondary Font: "Roboto Slab" (Serif)
    Use:
    Section Headings (h1, h2, h3).
    Blockquotes in the testimonials section.
    Reason:
    
    "Roboto Slab" provides a strong and professional appearance with its serif style, helping headings stand out.


    3. Accent Font: "Pacifico" (Handwriting)
    Use:
    Special elements such as the hero section's primary heading (#hero h1).
    Highlighted or decorative text (e.g., call-to-action phrases).
